# Network Vulnerability Scanner
test
This Python script is a simple network vulnerability scanner that uses Nmap to scan a specified IP range and ports for open services. The results are saved to a CSV file, making it easy to review and analyze the findings.

## Features

- Scans a specified IP range for open ports and services.
- Supports scanning a range of ports (default is 1-1024).
- Generates a detailed CSV report with IP addresses, ports, states, services, and versions.
- Automatically creates a timestamped report in the `reports` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `nmap` library
- Nmap installed on your system

## Installation

1. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install python-nmap
    ```

2. Ensure Nmap is installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. Open the script file and adjust the `ip_range` and `ports` variables as needed.
2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python vulnerability_scanner.py
    ```

3. The script will perform the scan and save the report to the `reports` directory with a timestamped filename.

## Example

```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py
